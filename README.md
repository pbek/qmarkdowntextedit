## Supported Markdown Features

Commonmark compliance is enforced where possible however we are not fully Commonmark compliant yet. Following is a list of features/extensions supported by the highlighter. Please note that this is just a plaintext editor and as such, it only does the highlighting and not rendering of the markdown to HTML.

## Usage

There are multiple ways to use this. You can use the editor directly, or you can subclass it or you can just use the highlighter.

### Using the editor

#### QMake

- Include [qmarkdowntextedit.pri](https://github.com/pbek/qmarkdowntextedit/blob/main/qmarkdowntextedit.pri)
  to your project like this `include (qmarkdowntextedit/qmarkdowntextedit.pri)`
- add a normal `QPlainTextEdit` to your UI and promote it to `QMarkdownTextEdit` (base class `QPlainTextEdit`)

#### CMake

- Include [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/pbek/qmarkdowntextedit/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt)
  to your project like this `add_subdirectory(qmarkdowntextedit)`
- add a normal `QPlainTextEdit` to your UI and promote it to `QMarkdownTextEdit` (base class `QPlainTextEdit`)

### Using the highlighter only

Highlighter can work with both `QPlainTextEdit` and `QTextEdit`. Example:

```cpp
auto doc = ui->plainTextEdit->document();
auto *highlighter = new MarkdownHighlighter(doc);
```
